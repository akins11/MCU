According to the American Cancer Society, the 5-year relative survival rates for melanoma skin cancer are over 99% for localized cases, 71% for regional cases, and 32% for distant cases. Melanoma originates in the melanocytes, the cells that produce skin pigment, and can be identified by changes in existing moles or the development of new, unusual-looking growths on the skin The purpose of this analysis is to investigate the survival of patients who have undergone surgery to remove malignant melanoma tumors.
